## Neighborhood Map Project

----
## Overview

This project uses the knockoutJS framework (http://knockoutjs.com/) for handling the list view, filter and fuzzy search functions. In addition, the Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) is used to display the data as map markers. The Google maps markers also render with information accessed from the wikipedia/MediaWiki API (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).
